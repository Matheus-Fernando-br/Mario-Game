# Simple Mario Jump Game

## Overview

This is a basic Mario-themed jumping game created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In this game, you control Mario as he jumps over pipes. The goal is to avoid collision with the pipes for as long as possible.

## Features

- Simple one-button gameplay (press any key to jump)
- Mario character that responds to player input
- Scrolling pipe obstacles
- Game over condition when Mario collides with a pipe
- Character image changes upon collision

## How to Play

1. Open the HTML file in your web browser
2. Press any key to make Mario jump
3. Time your jumps to avoid the oncoming pipes
4. The game ends if Mario collides with a pipe

## Future Improvements

I plan to enhance this game in the future. Some potential improvements include:

- Adding a score system
- Implementing different levels of difficulty
- Including sound effects and background music
- Creating power-ups for Mario
- Adding more diverse obstacles
